## Findings

In your rules files, ensure that the `selectCondition` property only accepts valid JMESPath expressions. Do not allow PowerShell commands or any other language; only JMESPath should be used to filter or select data in rules.

In the `path` property of rule files, only use a valid key from the Monkey365 data model. Do not allow PowerShell commands or expressions from any other language; only use paths that exist in the data model generated by the collectors.

## Rulesets

Findings can be used in multiple rulesets, use compliance in rulesets to apply overrides in findings.

When creating rulesets, ensure that the `compliance` property is used to apply overrides to findings. This allows for flexibility in how findings are applied across different rulesets.
- Ensure that the `compliance` property is used to apply overrides to findings in rulesets.
- Do not use the `compliance` property to override the `selectCondition` or `path` properties of findings.
