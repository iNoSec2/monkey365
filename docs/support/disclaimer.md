## Disclaimers, and the Azure Penetration testing policy

- To the best of our knowledge Monkey365's collectors are compliant with the Azure Penetration testing policy, but as a modular tool, we cannot guarantee this will be the case in every situation. It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that you know such requirements and how you use Monkey365 is compliant with the Azure Penetration testing policy.

- Although notifying Microsoft of pen testing activities is no longer required you must still comply with the <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement' target='_blank'>Microsoft Cloud Unified Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement</a>

- As with any other security tool, it is your responsibility to get proper authorization before using Monkey365 outside of your tenant/subscription.

- Please note that this PowerShell module was designed to help companies to make both Azure and Microsoft365 more secure and should never be used maliciously. 

- Monkey365 is software that comes with absolutely no warranties, either implied or explicit. By using Monkey365, you take full responsibility with any action taken using this software.
