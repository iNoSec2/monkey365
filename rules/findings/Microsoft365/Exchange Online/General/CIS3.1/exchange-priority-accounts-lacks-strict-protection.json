  "description": "
		Preset security policies have been established by Microsoft, utilizing observations and experiences within datacenters to strike a balance between the exclusion of malicious content from users and limiting unwarranted disruptions. These policies can apply to all, or select users and encompass recommendations for addressing spam, malware, and phishing threats. The policy parameters are pre-determined and non-adjustable. Strict protection has the most aggressive protection of the 3 presets. 

		* EOP: Anti-spam, Anti-malware and Anti-phishing 
		* Defender: Spoof protection, Impersonation protection and Advanced phishing 
		* Defender: Safe Links and Safe Attachments 

		*NOTE: The preset security polices cannot target Priority account TAGS currently, groups should be used instead.*
  ",
  "rationale": "
		Enabling priority account protection for users in Microsoft 365 is necessary to enhance security for accounts with access to sensitive data and high privileges, such as CEOs, CISOs, CFOs, and IT admins. These priority accounts are often targeted by spear phishing or whaling attacks and require stronger protection to prevent account compromise. 
		The implementation of stringent, pre-defined policies may result in instances of false positive, however, the benefit of requiring the end-user to preview junk email before accessing their inbox outweighs the potential risk of mistakenly perceiving a malicious email as safe due to its placement in the inbox.
