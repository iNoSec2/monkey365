  "description": "
		Exchange Online offers several methods of managing the flow of email messages. These are Remote domain, Transport Rules, and Anti-spam outbound policies. These methods work together to provide comprehensive coverage for potential automatic forwarding channels: 
		* Outlook forwarding using inbox rules. 
		* Outlook forwarding configured using OOF rule. 
		* OWA forwarding setting (ForwardingSmtpAddress). 
		* Forwarding set by the admin using EAC (ForwardingAddress). 
		* Forwarding using Power Automate / Flow. 

		Ensure a Transport rule and Anti-spam outbound policy are used to block mail forwarding. 
		**NOTE** : Any exclusions should be implemented based on organizational policy.

  "rationale": "Attackers often create these rules to exfiltrate data from your tenancy, this could be accomplished via access to an end-user account or otherwise. An insider could also use one of these methods as a secondary channel to exfiltrate sensitive data.",
  "impact": "Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case auto-forwarding. Disabling auto-forwarding to remote domains will affect all users and in an organization. Any exclusions should be implemented based on organizational policy.",
