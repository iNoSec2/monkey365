  "description": "Role-Based Access Control allows for permissions to be assigned to users based on their roles within an organization. It is a more manageable form of access control that is less prone to errors. These user roles can be audited inside of Microsoft Purview to provide a security auditor insight into user privilege change.",
  "rationale": "Weekly reviews provide an opportunity to identify rights changes in an organization and are a large part of maintaining Least Privilege and preventing Privilege creep. Insider Threats, either intentional or unintentional, can occur when a user has higher than needed privileges. Maintaining accountability of role membership will keep insiders and malicious actors limited in the scope of potential damaging activities.",
  "impact": "By performing regular reviews, the Administrators assigning rights to users will need to inevitably provide justification for those changes to security auditors. Documentation that includes detailed policies, procedures, and change requests will need to be considered to keep a secure organization functioning within its planned operational level.",
