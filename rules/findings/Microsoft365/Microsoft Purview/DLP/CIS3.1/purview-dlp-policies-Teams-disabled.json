		The default Teams Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy rule in Microsoft 365 is a preconfigured rule that is automatically applied to all Teams conversations and channels. The default rule helps prevent accidental sharing of sensitive information by detecting and blocking certain types of content that are deemed sensitive or inappropriate by the organization. 
		By default, the rule includes a check for the sensitive info type Credit Card Number which is pre-defined by Microsoft.

		Enabling the default Teams DLP policy rule in Microsoft 365 helps protect an organization's sensitive information by preventing accidental sharing or leakage Credit Card information in Teams conversations and channels. 
		DLP rules are not one size fits all, but at a minimum something should be defined. The organization should identify sensitive information important to them and seek to intercept it using DLP.

Administrators may receive requests from end-users for permission to share certain types of content or to modify the policy to better fit the needs of their teams.",
