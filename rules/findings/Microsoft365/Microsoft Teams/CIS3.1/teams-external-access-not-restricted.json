		This policy setting controls chat with external unmanaged Skype and Teams users. Users in the organization will not be searchable by unmanaged Skype or Teams users and will have to initiate all communications with unmanaged users. 
		**Note** : As of December 2021, the default for Teams external communication is set to `People in my organization can communicate with Teams users whose accounts aren't managed by an organization`. 
		**Note #2** : Skype for business is deprecated as of July 31, 2021, although these settings may still be valid for a period of time. See the link in the reference section for more information. 
  ",
  "rationale": "
		Allowing users to communicate with Skype or Teams users outside of an organization presents a potential security threat as external users can interact with organization users over Skype for Business or Teams. While legitimate, productivity-improving scenarios exist, they are outweighed by the risk of data loss, phishing, and social engineering attacks against organization users via Teams. Some real-world attacks and exploits delivered via Teams over external access channels include: 
		* DarkGate malware 
		* Social engineering / Phishing attacks by `Midnight Blizzard` 
		* GIFShell 
		* Username enumeration 
  ",
  "impact": "
		The impact of disabling external access to Teams and Skype for an organization is highly dependent on current usage practices. If users infrequently communicate with external parties using these channels, the impact is likely to be minimal. However, if users regularly use Teams and Skype for client communication, the impact could be significant. Therefore, before disabling external access, users should be notified, and alternate communication mechanisms should be identified to ensure continuity of communication. 
		**Note** : Chat with external unmanaged Teams users isn't available in GCC, GCC High, or DOD deployments, or in private cloud environments.
