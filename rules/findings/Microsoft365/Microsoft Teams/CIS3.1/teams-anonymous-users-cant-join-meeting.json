  "description": "This policy setting can prevent anyone other than invited attendees (people directly invited by the organizer, or to whom an invitation was forwarded) from bypassing the lobby and entering the meeting.",
  "rationale": "
		For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly sent an invite before admitting them to the meeting. This will also prevent the anonymous user from using the meeting link to have meetings at unscheduled times. 
		**Note** : Those companies that don't normally operate at a Level 2 environment, but do deal with sensitive information, may want to consider this policy setting.
