  "displayName": "Ensure Storage Logging is Enabled for Queue Service for 'Read', 'Write', and 'Delete' requests",
  "description": "The Storage Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client who has access to the storage account. A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18 or newer. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for both successful and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues. Storage Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests: Timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, and server latency, authentication details, concurrency information, and the sizes of the request and response messages.",
  "rationale": "Storage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis. Storage Analytics logging is not enabled by default for your storage account.",
  "impact": "Enabling this setting can have a high impact on the cost of the log analytics service and data storage used by logging more data per each request. Do not enable this without determining your need for this level of logging, and do not forget to check in on data usage and projected cost. Some users have seen their logging costs increase from $10 per month to $10,000 per month.",
