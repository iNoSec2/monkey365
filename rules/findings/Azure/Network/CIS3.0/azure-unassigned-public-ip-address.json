Open the `All Resources blade`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Click on `Add Filter`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3.

For each Public IP address in the list, use Overview (or Properties) to review the `Associated to:` field and determine if the associated resource is still relevant to your tenant environment. If the associated resource is relevant, ensure that additional controls exist to mitigate risk (e.g. Firewalls, VPNs, Traffic Filtering, Virtual Gateway Appliances, Web Application Firewalls, etc.) on all subsequently attached resources.",
