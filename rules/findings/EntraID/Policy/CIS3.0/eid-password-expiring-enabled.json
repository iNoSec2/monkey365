  "description": "Microsoft cloud-only accounts have a pre-defined password policy that cannot be changed. The only items that can change are the number of days until a password expires and whether or whether passwords expire at all.",
  "rationale": "Organizations such as NIST and Microsoft have updated their password policy recommendations to not arbitrarily require users to change their passwords after a specific amount of time, unless there is evidence that the password is compromised, or the user forgot it. They suggest this even for single factor (Password Only) use cases, with a reasoning that forcing arbitrary password changes on users actually make the passwords less secure. Other recommendations within this Benchmark suggest the use of MFA authentication for at least critical accounts (at minimum), which makes password expiration even less useful as well as password protection for Entra ID.",
  "impact": "
		When setting passwords not to expire it is important to have other controls in place to supplement this setting. See below for related recommendations and user guidance. 
		* Ban common passwords. 
		* Educate users to not reuse organization passwords anywhere else. 
		* Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication registration for all users.
