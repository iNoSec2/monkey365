  "rationale": "Limiting guest access ensures that guest accounts do not have permission for certain directory tasks, such as enumerating users, groups or other directory resources, and cannot be assigned to administrative roles in your directory. Guest access has three levels of restriction.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Guest users have the same access as members (most inclusive)\r\n\t\t2. Guest users have limited access to properties and memberships of directory objects (default value)\r\n\t\t3. Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects (most restrictive)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe recommended option is the 3rd, most restrictive: `Guest user access is restricted to their own directory object`.",
