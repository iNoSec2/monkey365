		This report contains records of accounts that have had activity that could indicate they are compromised, such as accounts that have: 
		* Successfully signed in after multiple failures, which is an indication that the accounts have cracked passwords. 
		* Signed in to tenant from a client IP address that has been recognized by Microsoft as an anonymous proxy IP address (such as a TOR network). 
		* Successful sign-ins from users where two sign-ins appeared to originate from different regions and the time between sign-ins makes it impossible for the user to have travelled between those regions.
